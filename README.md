# eeshow
Eeshow - Eeschema schematics renderer and viewer.

Forked from http://neo900.org/stuff/eeshow/.

See https://github.com/robkam/eeshow/wiki for more info.

In the transition between KiCad 4 and KiCad 5 the savefiles format has changed the way libraries are looked up. So Eeshow now needs an update to support both versions.
